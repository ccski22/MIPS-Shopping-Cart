# MIPS-Shopping-Cart

Program loops over several processor inputs and determines whether you want to purchase each processor. Outside the loop, the user is prompted for their desired execution time in seconds (a whole number). Inside the loop, the user will be prompted for the price and average CPI of processor (both integers). If the execution time is less than or equal to the target, then you will add the processor to your cart to “purchase” it. When the user indicates that they are finished looping, the total amount of money spent and number of processors purchased should be outputted.

#I/O Examples
Example 1
